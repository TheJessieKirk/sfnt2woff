# *sfnt2woff* README
This is a mirror of Jonathan Kew's *sfnt2woff* tool.

It converts font file formats from SFNT (OpenType and TrueType) to WOFF format and *vice-versa*.<br />
(Note: it can't handle WOFF2 files.)

Jonathan Kew's website has been down since 2017, but an archived version is available from the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/https://people.mozilla.org/~jkew/woff/).
